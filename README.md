<summary>Exercise 2: Bash Script - Install Java </summary>
 <br />

 As i was using an online platform for the OS everything was brand new so i had to start with installing VIM 

 Then after creating the file and writting the script i had to give permission to the user to execute it.

Breakdown of command that gets java version:
- `java -version` gives you the complete version output.
- `2>&1 > /dev/null` addition does following things: with `2>&1` the error output of the `java -version` command will be discarded by the `/dev/null` file, and `>` redirects the output of `java -version` command to the `/dev/null` file, which is a special type of file, that accepts and discards all input written to it. So described together, this option takes the output, including any errors generated by the `java -version` command and discards it, not showing it on the command-line and silently forwarding it using `|` (pipe) to the next command, which is `grep "java version\|openjdk version"`
- `grep "java version\|openjdk version"` simply finds a line in the output that has "java version" or "openjdk version" in it. The example line will look like this: openjdk version "11.0.16" 2022-07-19
- `awk '{print substr($3,2,2)}` takes the line from the previous output and grabs the third section of the string "11.0.16" and from there grabs the first 2 characters, which will be "11"


*Detailed explanation of `2>&1`:

Every time, we execute a program or a command, operating system opens three files: **standard input**, **standard output**, and **standard error**, and each file gets a file descriptor integer from the OS: 0, 1, and 2, respectively. So 2>&1 simply says redirect standard error (2) to standard output (1). The `&` before `1` in this case, means whatever follows is a file descriptor, not a filename. 

Explanation of `if else` script:
- In the if else checks, we check if the $java_version variable has no value at all or empty value, it means we have no java installation at all
- If you have an older version of java already installed, like 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, then the value of `"$java_version"` will be `"1."` - first 2 characters. So with `"$java_version" == "1."`, we check whether `java_version` variable is `"1."`. This means installing latest java version was not successful, since you still have only the old version.
- In case of success you should get java version which is 11 or higher (`"$java_version" -ge 11`), which will print success message.
